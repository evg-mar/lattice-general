General implementation of a Lattice structure. A lattice is a POS (partially ordered set) 
possessing the additional property of existance of LUB (least upper bound) and GLB 
(greatest lower bound) for every finite subset of the POS. It can be used in multiple 
problems where Lattice algorithms can apply. For every target domain, concrete base 
Universe should be implemented, having the needed interface methods.
